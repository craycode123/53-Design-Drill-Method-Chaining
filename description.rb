<div><p>Method chaining is a programming technique for making your code more concise and eloquent.</p>
<p>It is often useful to write your programs out on many lines so that you can visualize the functionality more easily. This is a great first step, but it may not be the most readable or efficient way to write your code.</p>
<p>You should always refactor your code to make it more clear, readable, and concise. Method chaining is one tool that you can make use of towards this end.</p>
<p>However, it can be taken too far. Getting your code to fit on the fewest possible number of lines is nice, but it can also lead to very unreadable and convoluted code.</p>
<p>In the Ruby world, it is considered more professional to write readable, elegant code than extra-compact, complex code.</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<h4>1. Increase elegance with chaining</h4>
<p>Refactor the statements within the method body of <code class="inline">shout_backwards</code> into one line of code.</p>
<p>It should still be clear what the methodâ€™s behavior is even after you refactor.</p>
<h4>2. Refactor for clarity</h4>
<p>Break down the convoluted statement within <code class="inline">squared_primes</code> so that it reads more smoothly.</p>
<p>It should be much clearer what the method is doing after you refactor.</p>
